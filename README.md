## Methodology
The research follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Bacterial pathogens and their ecological features were compiled from public datasets.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Focused on key factors such as:
   - Transmissibility
   - Tissue Tropism
   - Severity
3. **Model Development**: Used classification algorithms to predict virulence:
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting

## Results
### Key Findings
1. **Feature Importance**:
   - The most significant predictors of bacterial virulence are:
     - **Tissue Tropism**: Pathogens with neural or renal tropism have higher virulence.
     - **Transmissibility**: Pathogens with limited person-to-person transmission are more likely to cause severe disease.
     - **Severity Scale**: Measures the potential impact of pathogens on human health.
2. **Model Performance**:
   - The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best performance among all tested models, demonstrating:
     - **Accuracy**: 94.5%
